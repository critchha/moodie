# Task ID: 27
# Title: Task #27: Final QA, User Acceptance Testing, and Production Launch Preparation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct comprehensive regression testing, collect and incorporate user feedback, and prepare all systems and documentation for public launch including final security audits and performance optimization.
# Details:
This task involves several critical pre-launch activities:

1. Regression Testing:
   - Execute full regression test suite across all environments (dev, staging, production)
   - Verify all core functionality works as expected after recent containerization and CI/CD implementations
   - Perform cross-browser and cross-device compatibility testing
   - Run load and stress tests to ensure system stability under expected user traffic

2. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
   - Identify and engage a group of beta testers representing target user personas
   - Create structured test scenarios covering primary user journeys
   - Collect feedback through surveys, interviews, and automated analytics
   - Prioritize and address critical issues identified during UAT

3. Security and Compliance:
   - Conduct final security audit including penetration testing
   - Verify compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
   - Review data handling practices and privacy policy implementation
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging without sensitive data exposure

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Analyze application performance metrics
   - Optimize database queries and API response times
   - Implement caching strategies where appropriate
   - Verify CDN configuration for static assets

5. Launch Preparation:
   - Create a detailed launch plan with rollback procedures
   - Prepare marketing and communication materials
   - Set up monitoring dashboards and alerts
   - Establish post-launch support processes and escalation paths
   - Verify backup and disaster recovery procedures

6. Documentation Finalization:
   - Update user documentation with latest features
   - Prepare internal knowledge base for customer support
   - Document known issues and workarounds if applicable

# Test Strategy:
The completion of this task will be verified through:

1. Regression Testing Verification:
   - Review automated test reports showing 100% pass rate for critical paths
   - Verify test coverage metrics meet or exceed 90% for core functionality
   - Document manual testing results with screenshots and session recordings
   - Confirm performance test results meet defined SLAs (e.g., response times under 200ms for API calls)

2. UAT Validation:
   - Collect signed UAT approval documents from stakeholders
   - Compile user feedback summary with actionable insights
   - Verify all critical and high-priority issues from UAT have been resolved
   - Document any deferred issues with justification and timeline for post-launch fixes

3. Security Compliance:
   - Obtain security audit report with no critical or high vulnerabilities
   - Verify OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities have been addressed
   - Document compliance with relevant regulations
   - Confirm proper implementation of security headers and configurations

4. Launch Readiness:
   - Complete pre-launch checklist signed off by all department leads
   - Verify monitoring systems are properly configured with appropriate alerts
   - Conduct a "go/no-go" meeting with all stakeholders
   - Perform a dry-run of the launch process in staging environment
   - Verify DNS, SSL certificates, and other infrastructure components are properly configured

5. Post-Launch Monitoring Plan:
   - Establish metrics for launch success (user adoption, performance, error rates)
   - Create dashboard for real-time monitoring during and after launch
   - Document escalation procedures and on-call schedule for the launch period
   - Prepare post-launch retrospective template
