# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Wildcard and Comfort Recommendation Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement two new recommendation features: 'Wildcard' for surprising users with unexpected content, and 'Comfort' for suggesting familiar favorites based on user history and preferences.
# Details:
This task involves extending the recommendation engine to support two new recommendation types:

1. Wildcard Feature:
   - Implement an algorithm that selects random or unexpected content that falls outside the user's typical preferences
   - Create logic to occasionally suggest content from genres the user rarely explores
   - Develop a "surprise factor" scoring mechanism to ensure recommendations are genuinely unexpected
   - Integrate with the existing recommendation system to allow for wildcard suggestions to appear at configurable intervals
   - Add a user preference toggle in the configuration system (from Task #18) to enable/disable wildcard recommendations

2. Comfort Feature:
   - Analyze user history to identify patterns of repeated content consumption
   - Implement an algorithm to detect user's "comfort genres" based on frequency and duration of engagement
   - Create a scoring system that prioritizes familiar content during specific contexts (e.g., evening hours, weekends)
   - Develop a "comfort level" metric for content that indicates how closely it matches the user's established preferences
   - Add configuration options to adjust the frequency of comfort recommendations

Technical Implementation:
   - Extend the recommendation database schema (from Task #17) to include fields for wildcard and comfort metrics
   - Create new API endpoints in FastAPI (following Task #16) for explicitly requesting wildcard or comfort recommendations
   - Implement background processing to pre-calculate comfort scores for efficiency
   - Design the system to respect user privacy while still gathering sufficient data for meaningful recommendations
   - Ensure all new features work with the configuration management system from Task #18

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature will require a comprehensive approach across multiple levels:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for the core algorithms of both wildcard and comfort recommendation logic
   - Test edge cases such as new users with limited history, users with very narrow preferences, etc.
   - Verify that the scoring mechanisms produce expected results for known test cases

2. Integration Testing:
   - Ensure the new recommendation types integrate properly with the existing recommendation engine
   - Verify that the configuration options correctly modify the behavior of both features
   - Test the interaction between the recommendation system and the database schema

3. System Testing:
   - Create automated tests that simulate user behavior over time and verify appropriate recommendations
   - Test performance under load to ensure recommendation generation remains efficient
   - Verify that the system properly balances between regular, wildcard, and comfort recommendations

4. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Develop a test plan for human evaluators to assess the quality of recommendations
   - Create a feedback mechanism for testers to rate the relevance of wildcard and comfort suggestions
   - Collect metrics on surprise factor and comfort level as perceived by real users

5. A/B Testing:
   - Implement an A/B testing framework to compare different algorithms for both features
   - Measure engagement metrics to determine which approach yields better user satisfaction
   - Test different frequencies and presentation methods for wildcard recommendations

Success Criteria:
   - Wildcard recommendations should be genuinely surprising yet still somewhat relevant to users
   - Comfort recommendations should have a high correlation with previously enjoyed content
   - System performance should remain within acceptable parameters
   - User feedback should indicate positive reception of both features

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Wildcard and Comfort Recommendation Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create detailed algorithm designs for both the Wildcard (unexpected recommendations) and Comfort (familiar recommendations) features
### Details:
Define the mathematical models and decision trees for both algorithms. For Wildcard, focus on serendipity factors and novelty metrics. For Comfort, identify patterns in user history and preference consistency. Include pseudocode and flowcharts for both algorithms.

## 2. Extend Database Schema for New Recommendation Types [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Modify the existing database schema to support Wildcard and Comfort recommendation types and their associated metadata
### Details:
Add new tables and fields to store recommendation types, novelty scores, familiarity metrics, and user comfort zones. Include migration scripts, index optimizations, and documentation for the schema changes.

## 3. Implement Scoring System for Both Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Develop and implement the scoring systems that will rank items for both Wildcard and Comfort recommendations
### Details:
Create weighted scoring functions for novelty (Wildcard) and familiarity (Comfort). Implement normalization techniques, threshold configurations, and score aggregation methods. Include A/B testing capability to compare different scoring approaches.

## 4. Integrate User Preference Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2, 19.3
### Description: Add user interface elements and backend support for users to control their Wildcard and Comfort recommendation preferences
### Details:
Design and implement UI controls for users to adjust their openness to new experiences (Wildcard intensity) and desire for familiar recommendations (Comfort level). Create API endpoints to store and retrieve these preferences, and integrate them with the recommendation algorithms.

## 5. Develop Testing Framework for Recommendation Quality [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Create a comprehensive testing framework to evaluate the effectiveness of both recommendation features
### Details:
Implement objective metrics to measure recommendation quality, including surprise factor, user satisfaction, and recommendation diversity. Create automated tests, user simulation tools, and feedback collection mechanisms. Design experiments to validate both features against user expectations.

## 6. Optimize Performance and Scale Recommendation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3, 19.5
### Description: Ensure the new recommendation features perform efficiently at scale with minimal impact on system resources
### Details:
Profile and optimize algorithm performance, implement caching strategies, and ensure database queries are efficient. Create background processing for recommendation pre-computation where appropriate. Conduct load testing to verify the system can handle peak traffic with both features enabled.
