# Task ID: 23
# Title: Task #23: Implement Comprehensive Test Suite for Backend and Frontend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and implement a robust testing framework with integration and end-to-end tests for both backend (using pytest and httpx) and frontend (using Cypress and Playwright) to ensure comprehensive test coverage for all critical application paths.
# Details:
This task involves creating a comprehensive testing strategy that covers both backend and frontend components:

Backend Testing (pytest, httpx):
1. Set up pytest fixtures for database connections, API clients, and authentication
2. Implement integration tests for all API endpoints, focusing on:
   - User authentication and authorization flows
   - Data persistence and retrieval operations
   - Recommendation engine functionality (from Task #20)
   - Error handling and edge cases
3. Create mocks for external dependencies and services
4. Implement parameterized tests to cover various input scenarios
5. Set up CI pipeline integration for automated test execution

Frontend Testing (Cypress, Playwright):
1. Configure both Cypress and Playwright testing environments
2. Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys:
   - User registration and login flows
   - Core application functionality
   - UI/UX enhancements from Task #22 (onboarding, settings, feedback mechanisms)
   - React component interactions from Task #21
   - Recommendation system user interactions
3. Create visual regression tests for UI components
4. Implement cross-browser testing strategy
5. Set up test recording and reporting

Additional Requirements:
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- Document all test cases with clear descriptions
- Implement test data generation utilities
- Create a test execution strategy for local development and CI/CD pipelines

# Test Strategy:
The completion of this task will be verified through the following approach:

1. Code Review:
   - Examine test code organization, readability, and maintainability
   - Verify test isolation and independence
   - Check for appropriate use of testing frameworks and best practices

2. Test Coverage Analysis:
   - Run coverage reports for both backend and frontend code
   - Verify minimum 80% coverage for critical paths
   - Identify any gaps in test coverage for important functionality

3. Test Execution:
   - Run the complete test suite locally to verify all tests pass
   - Verify tests run successfully in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Check test execution time and optimize slow-running tests

4. Documentation Review:
   - Verify comprehensive test documentation
   - Ensure test cases map to functional requirements
   - Check for clear setup and execution instructions

5. Quality Assurance:
   - Validate that tests catch actual bugs by introducing deliberate errors
   - Verify tests are resilient to minor UI changes
   - Ensure tests properly handle asynchronous operations

6. Demonstration:
   - Present the test suite execution to the team
   - Demonstrate how to write new tests following the established patterns
   - Show test reports and coverage metrics
