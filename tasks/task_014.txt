# Task ID: 14
# Title: Dockerize the Application
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create Docker configuration to containerize the entire application for easy deployment.
# Details:
1. Create Dockerfile in project root:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   
   WORKDIR /app
   
   # Install dependencies
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   
   # Copy application code
   COPY app/ ./app/
   
   # Create directories for data and models
   RUN mkdir -p app/data app/models
   
   # Expose port
   EXPOSE 5000
   
   # Set environment variables
   ENV FLASK_APP=app/backend/app.py
   ENV FLASK_ENV=production
   
   # Run the application
   CMD ["python", "app/backend/app.py"]
   ```
2. Create docker-compose.yml for easier management:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   
   services:
     plex-recommender:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
       volumes:
         - ./app/data:/app/app/data
         - ./app/models:/app/app/models
       restart: unless-stopped
       environment:
         - FLASK_APP=app/backend/app.py
         - FLASK_ENV=production
   ```
3. Add .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files
4. Create startup script for initializing the application
5. Document Docker usage in README.md

# Test Strategy:
Build Docker image and verify it runs correctly. Test application functionality within the container. Verify data persistence using Docker volumes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Dockerfile [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Dockerfile that properly packages the application with all dependencies
### Details:
Define the base image, set up the working directory, copy application files, install dependencies, expose necessary ports, and specify the command to run the application. Ensure the image is optimized for size and security by using multi-stage builds if appropriate.

## 2. Configure docker-compose.yml [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create a docker-compose configuration to manage multiple services
### Details:
Define all required services (application, database, cache, etc.), set environment variables, configure networks, and establish service dependencies. Ensure proper startup order using depends_on and healthchecks where necessary.

## 3. Implement Volume Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Set up Docker volumes for persistent data storage
### Details:
Identify data that needs to persist between container restarts (database files, uploaded content, logs, etc.). Configure named volumes in docker-compose.yml, establish proper mount points, and ensure appropriate permissions for the container user.

## 4. Create Deployment Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Document the Docker setup and deployment process
### Details:
Write comprehensive documentation covering: prerequisites, build instructions, environment variable configuration, deployment commands, volume backup procedures, container health monitoring, and troubleshooting steps. Include examples for both development and production environments.
