# Details:
1. Set up testing framework with pytest:
```python
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from backend.main import app
import json

client = TestClient(app)

@pytest.fixture
def mock_plex_data():
    # Mock data for testing
    return {
        "movies": [
            {
                "media_id": "movie1",
                "title": "Test Movie 1",
                "type": "movie",
                "duration": 5400000,  # 1.5 hours
                "genres": ["Comedy", "Action"],
                "year": 2020,
                "summary": "A test movie",
                "view_count": 0
            },
            # Add more mock movies
        ],
        "shows": [
            # Mock TV shows
        ]
    }

def test_recommend_endpoint(mock_plex_data, monkeypatch):
    # Mock the Plex connector
    def mock_get_recommendations(*args, **kwargs):
        return {
            "primary": mock_plex_data["movies"][0],
            "backup": mock_plex_data["movies"][1] if len(mock_plex_data["movies"]) > 1 else None,
            "wildcard": mock_plex_data["shows"][0] if mock_plex_data["shows"] else None
        }
    
    # Apply the mock
    monkeypatch.setattr("backend.recommendation.RecommendationEngine.get_recommendations", mock_get_recommendations)
    
    # Test the endpoint
    response = client.get("/recommend", params={
        "time_available": "1-2h",
        "mood": "Light/Funny",
        "format": "Any",
        "comfort_mode": "false",
        "surprise_pick": "true"
    })
    
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "primary" in data
    assert data["primary"]["title"] == "Test Movie 1"

def test_feedback_endpoint():
    response = client.post("/feedback", json={
        "media_id": "movie1",
        "watched_completion": True,
        "would_watch_again": True,
        "rating": 5
    })
    
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "success"

def test_train_endpoint():
    response = client.post("/train")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

2. Create mock data for testing
3. Implement tests for all API endpoints
4. Add tests for error handling and edge cases
5. Create performance tests for recommendation engine
6. Implement end-to-end tests for complete user flows

# Test Strategy:
1. Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
2. Verify all endpoints return expected responses
3. Test with various input combinations
4. Verify error handling works correctly
5. Benchmark performance under load
6. Test with mock Plex server

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up API testing framework [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Select and configure an appropriate testing framework for API integration tests
### Details:
Research and select a suitable testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Postman). Install necessary dependencies, configure the test environment, and set up the project structure for organizing tests. Include configuration for test reporting and CI/CD integration.

## 2. Create mock data for tests [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop comprehensive mock data sets for all API test scenarios
### Details:
Create realistic mock data that covers various test cases. Include valid data, edge cases, and invalid data. Organize mock data in a reusable format. Consider using factories or fixtures to generate dynamic test data when needed.

## 3. Implement endpoint tests [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Develop tests for all API endpoints covering CRUD operations
### Details:
Create test suites for each API endpoint. Include tests for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations as applicable. Verify correct response codes, payload structure, and data integrity. Ensure tests are isolated and can run independently.

## 4. Implement error handling tests [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Create tests to verify API error responses and edge cases
### Details:
Develop tests that trigger various error conditions (invalid inputs, unauthorized access, resource not found, etc.). Verify that the API returns appropriate error codes and messages. Test validation logic and ensure security constraints are enforced.

## 5. Implement performance tests [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3
### Description: Create tests to measure and verify API performance metrics
### Details:
Set up performance testing scenarios to measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization. Define acceptable performance thresholds. Implement load tests for critical endpoints. Create reports to track performance metrics over time.

## 6. Develop end-to-end test scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: 14.3, 14.4, 14.5
### Description: Create comprehensive test flows that simulate real user interactions across multiple endpoints
### Details:
Implement test scenarios that chain multiple API calls to simulate complete user workflows. Verify data consistency across the entire flow. Include authentication flows, multi-step processes, and scenarios that involve state changes across multiple resources.
