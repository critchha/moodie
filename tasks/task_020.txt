# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Machine Learning Recommendation Engine with Collaborative Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a machine learning-driven recommendation system that leverages collaborative filtering to analyze user feedback and history for generating personalized content suggestions.
# Details:
This task involves building a sophisticated recommendation engine that goes beyond the existing recommendation features (Wildcard and Comfort) by incorporating machine learning algorithms:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
   - Integrate with existing user history and feedback data from the database
   - Implement data preprocessing pipelines to clean and normalize user interaction data
   - Create feature extraction mechanisms for both users and content items

2. Collaborative Filtering Implementation:
   - Develop a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm to find similar users
   - Implement item-based collaborative filtering to identify content relationships
   - Create a hybrid approach that combines both methods for optimal recommendations

3. Model Training and Evaluation:
   - Design a training pipeline that periodically retrains the model with new user data
   - Implement cross-validation to evaluate model performance
   - Create metrics for measuring recommendation quality (precision, recall, diversity)

4. Integration with Existing System:
   - Extend the current recommendation API to include ML-driven suggestions
   - Ensure compatibility with the existing configuration management system (Task #18)
   - Implement caching mechanisms to optimize performance for real-time recommendations

5. Feedback Loop Implementation:
   - Create mechanisms to capture explicit user feedback (ratings, likes) and implicit feedback (viewing time, clicks)
   - Design a system that continuously improves recommendations based on new feedback
   - Implement A/B testing capabilities to compare different recommendation algorithms

6. Documentation:
   - Document the ML architecture, algorithms, and data flow
   - Create developer guides for maintaining and extending the recommendation engine
   - Provide API documentation for frontend integration

Technical considerations:
- Use appropriate ML libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch) based on complexity needs
- Ensure the system scales with growing user base and content catalog
- Address cold start problems for new users and new content items
- Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy for the machine learning recommendation engine should be comprehensive and multi-faceted:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test individual components of the recommendation engine (data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training)
   - Verify correct implementation of collaborative filtering algorithms
   - Test edge cases like new users, users with limited history, and niche content items

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify proper integration with the existing database schema (Task #17)
   - Test compatibility with the configuration management system (Task #18)
   - Ensure the recommendation engine works with existing Wildcard and Comfort features (Task #19)

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark recommendation generation time under various loads
   - Test system performance with simulated large user bases (10K, 100K, 1M users)
   - Verify caching mechanisms effectively reduce response times

4. Accuracy Testing:
   - Implement offline evaluation using historical data with metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score
   - Compare recommendations against a ground truth dataset
   - Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness

5. A/B Testing Framework:
   - Verify the A/B testing mechanism correctly segments users
   - Test that different recommendation algorithms can be deployed simultaneously
   - Ensure proper metrics collection for comparing algorithm performance

6. User Feedback Loop Testing:
   - Verify that user feedback is correctly captured and incorporated into the model
   - Test that the model improves over time with simulated feedback data
   - Validate that explicit and implicit feedback mechanisms work as expected

7. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create test scenarios that simulate real user journeys
   - Verify recommendations change appropriately based on user behavior
   - Test the entire pipeline from user action to recommendation generation

8. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Recommendation quality metrics exceed baseline by at least 15%
   - System generates recommendations in under 200ms for 95% of requests
   - Cold start recommendations are reasonable for new users
   - System successfully incorporates user feedback to improve future recommendations
