# Task ID: 22
# Title: Task #22: Implement Comprehensive UI/UX Enhancements and User Experience Flows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a suite of UI/UX improvements including user onboarding, settings panel, advanced feedback mechanisms, 'Wildcard' and 'Comfort' UI options, loading states, error handling, and microinteractions to enhance overall user experience.
# Details:
This task involves enhancing the application's user interface and experience through several key improvements:

1. User Onboarding:
   - Create a step-by-step onboarding flow for new users
   - Design welcome screens explaining key features
   - Implement progress indicators and skip options
   - Add tooltips for first-time users on main features

2. Settings Panel:
   - Develop a comprehensive settings interface with user preferences
   - Include account management, notification preferences, theme options
   - Implement save/cancel functionality with confirmation dialogs
   - Ensure settings persist across sessions

3. Advanced Feedback Flows:
   - Design intuitive rating systems for content
   - Implement detailed feedback forms with multiple input types
   - Create feedback confirmation and thank you screens
   - Add ability to edit or retract previous feedback

4. 'Wildcard' and 'Comfort' UI Options:
   - Design distinct visual indicators for Wildcard vs Comfort recommendations
   - Implement toggle switches between recommendation modes
   - Create appropriate animations for transitions between modes
   - Ensure visual consistency with existing recommendation UI

5. Loading States:
   - Implement skeleton screens for content loading
   - Design and add progress indicators for longer operations
   - Create smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
   - Ensure loading states are visually consistent with the app's design

6. Error Handling:
   - Design user-friendly error messages
   - Implement recovery options for common errors
   - Create fallback UI states for failed operations
   - Add retry mechanisms where appropriate

7. Microinteractions:
   - Add subtle animations for user actions (clicks, swipes, etc.)
   - Implement visual feedback for successful operations
   - Design transition effects between screens
   - Create hover states and focus indicators for interactive elements

Technical considerations:
- All UI components should be implemented as React components
- Ensure responsive design works across device sizes
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Use the existing design system for consistency
- Document all new components in Storybook
- Implement proper state management for UI states

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this UI/UX enhancement task will require a comprehensive approach across multiple dimensions:

1. Component Testing:
   - Write Jest unit tests for all new React components
   - Test each component in isolation with various props and states
   - Verify that components render correctly in different viewport sizes
   - Test accessibility with jest-axe for WCAG compliance

2. Integration Testing:
   - Use React Testing Library to test component interactions
   - Verify that components work together as expected
   - Test navigation flows between different UI states
   - Ensure data is properly passed between components

3. User Flow Testing:
   - Create Cypress end-to-end tests for each major user flow:
     - Complete onboarding process
     - Change and save settings
     - Submit feedback through various paths
     - Toggle between Wildcard and Comfort modes
     - Encounter and recover from errors
   - Test happy paths and error scenarios

4. Visual Regression Testing:
   - Implement Storybook visual tests with Chromatic
   - Capture screenshots of components in various states
   - Compare against baseline to catch unintended visual changes
   - Test across multiple browsers and viewport sizes

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and set baselines for component render times
   - Test loading performance with throttled network conditions
   - Verify animations run at 60fps on target devices
   - Check bundle size impact of new components

6. Usability Testing:
   - Conduct moderated usability sessions with 5-7 users
   - Create specific tasks for users to complete
   - Gather qualitative feedback on the new UI elements
   - Measure task completion rates and time-on-task

7. A/B Testing:
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Set up analytics to track engagement metrics
   - Compare user behavior with and without new features
   - Measure impact on key performance indicators

Acceptance Criteria:
- All automated tests pass with >90% coverage
- Usability testing shows >85% task completion rate
- Performance metrics meet or exceed existing baselines
- Design review approval from product and design teams
- Accessibility audit passes with no major issues

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design User Onboarding Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an intuitive onboarding experience for new users that explains key features and functionality
### Details:
Design wireframes and mockups for a step-by-step onboarding process, including welcome screens, feature highlights, and user preference setup. Ensure the flow is skippable for returning users and incorporates progressive disclosure principles.

## 2. Implement Settings Panel [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive settings interface allowing users to customize their experience
### Details:
Create a well-organized settings panel with categories for account preferences, notification settings, display options, and privacy controls. Include toggle switches, dropdown menus, and other appropriate UI controls with proper state management.

## 3. Enhance Feedback System [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Improve the user feedback collection mechanism with more interactive elements
### Details:
Implement in-app feedback forms, rating prompts, and contextual feedback collection points. Design feedback UI components that are non-intrusive yet easily accessible, with appropriate validation and submission confirmation.
