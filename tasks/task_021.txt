# Task ID: 21
# Title: Task #21: Migrate Frontend to React Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Transition the existing frontend to a React-based architecture by scaffolding a new React application, converting current UI elements to React components, and ensuring seamless integration with the FastAPI backend.
# Details:
This migration requires a systematic approach:

1. Initial Setup:
   - Use Create React App or Next.js to scaffold a new React application
   - Set up project structure following best practices (components, pages, hooks, services)
   - Configure build tools, linting, and TypeScript (if applicable)
   - Establish a component library structure with storybook documentation

2. Component Migration:
   - Identify and prioritize UI components for migration
   - Create reusable React components that match existing functionality
   - Implement state management using React Context API or Redux
   - Ensure components follow React best practices (pure components, hooks, etc.)

3. Backend Integration:
   - Create API service layer to communicate with FastAPI backend
   - Implement authentication flow and token management
   - Set up proper error handling and loading states
   - Ensure data fetching strategies are optimized (consider React Query)

4. Cross-cutting Concerns:
   - Implement responsive design using CSS-in-JS or styled-components
   - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
   - Create a theming system with light/dark mode support
   - Implement internationalization (i18n) if required

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Ensure fast initial load and time-to-interactive metrics

6. Migration Strategy:
   - Consider incremental migration approach if needed
   - Plan for potential downtime or feature freeze during cutover
   - Create fallback mechanisms in case of issues

This task should be coordinated with backend developers to ensure API endpoints are properly documented and accessible for the new React frontend.

# Test Strategy:
The migration should be verified through a comprehensive testing approach:

1. Component Testing:
   - Write Jest unit tests for all React components
   - Use React Testing Library for component interaction testing
   - Achieve minimum 80% test coverage for component code
   - Verify component rendering in various states (loading, error, success)

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration between React components
   - Verify proper data flow through the component hierarchy
   - Test interactions between components and state management

3. API Integration Testing:
   - Mock API responses for testing frontend in isolation
   - Test actual API integration with the FastAPI backend
   - Verify error handling and edge cases
   - Test authentication flows and protected routes

4. End-to-End Testing:
   - Implement Cypress or Playwright tests for critical user journeys
   - Test complete workflows from UI to backend and database
   - Verify that existing functionality works as expected in the new implementation

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use automated tools (axe, Lighthouse) to verify WCAG compliance
   - Perform manual testing with screen readers
   - Test keyboard navigation throughout the application
   - Verify color contrast and text sizing

6. Responsive Testing:
   - Test on various device sizes and orientations
   - Verify breakpoints work as expected
   - Test touch interactions on mobile devices

7. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and compare performance metrics before and after migration
   - Use Lighthouse to verify performance scores
   - Test load times and interactivity on various network conditions

8. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct UAT with stakeholders to verify the migrated UI meets requirements
   - Compare side-by-side with existing UI to ensure feature parity
   - Gather feedback on any usability improvements or regressions

Document all test results and address any issues before final deployment.
