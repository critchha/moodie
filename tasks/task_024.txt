# Task ID: 24
# Title: Task #24: Set up CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions for Automated Testing and Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate code quality checks, testing, Docker image building, and deployment to staging and production environments.
# Details:
The implementation should include the following components:

1. **Repository Setup**:
   - Configure branch protection rules for main/master branch
   - Set up required status checks before merging
   - Configure environment secrets for deployment credentials

2. **Workflow Files**:
   - Create `.github/workflows/` directory with separate workflow files:
     - `lint.yml` - For code quality checks
     - `test.yml` - For running the test suite
     - `build.yml` - For Docker image building
     - `deploy-staging.yml` - For staging deployment
     - `deploy-production.yml` - For production deployment

3. **Linting Workflow**:
   - Configure ESLint/Prettier for frontend code
   - Configure Flake8/Black for Python backend code
   - Run on pull requests and pushes to main branch

4. **Testing Workflow**:
   - Integrate with existing pytest suite for backend
   - Integrate with Cypress/Playwright for frontend tests
   - Generate and store test reports as artifacts
   - Configure test coverage reporting

5. **Build Workflow**:
   - Set up Docker image building with proper tagging
   - Push images to a container registry (GitHub Container Registry or similar)
   - Cache Docker layers for faster builds

6. **Deployment Workflows**:
   - Implement automatic deployment to staging on successful merges to main
   - Configure manual approval for production deployments
   - Include rollback mechanisms for failed deployments
   - Set up environment-specific configuration

7. **Monitoring and Notifications**:
   - Configure Slack/email notifications for pipeline status
   - Set up monitoring for deployment success/failure

8. **Documentation**:
   - Document the CI/CD process for developers
   - Create troubleshooting guide for common pipeline issues

# Test Strategy:
The CI/CD pipeline implementation should be verified through the following steps:

1. **Workflow Validation**:
   - Run `act` or similar tool locally to test GitHub Actions workflows before pushing
   - Verify syntax of all workflow files using GitHub Actions linting tools

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Create a test branch and push changes to trigger each workflow
   - Verify each step in the pipeline executes correctly
   - Confirm proper handling of failing tests or linting errors

3. **Deployment Verification**:
   - Confirm successful deployment to staging environment
   - Verify the deployed application functions correctly in staging
   - Test the manual approval process for production deployment
   - Verify production deployment completes successfully

4. **Security Testing**:
   - Audit workflow files for potential security issues
   - Verify secrets are properly managed and not exposed in logs
   - Confirm proper permission settings for GitHub Actions

5. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Measure and document pipeline execution times
   - Identify and optimize slow steps in the workflow
   - Verify caching mechanisms are working correctly

6. **Failure Scenarios**:
   - Test rollback functionality by intentionally deploying a broken build
   - Verify notification systems work when pipelines fail
   - Test recovery procedures for interrupted deployments

7. **Documentation Review**:
   - Have team members follow documentation to ensure clarity
   - Verify all error messages in the pipeline are documented with solutions

8. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Have developers use the pipeline for their regular workflow
   - Collect feedback on usability and pain points
   - Verify the pipeline integrates well with the existing development process

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Repository Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up repository settings and permissions for GitHub Actions
### Details:
Enable GitHub Actions in repository settings, configure branch protection rules, set up required secrets (API keys, deployment credentials), and establish proper access controls for the CI/CD pipeline.

## 2. Create Basic Workflow File [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Develop the initial GitHub Actions workflow file structure
### Details:
Create a .github/workflows directory and implement a basic workflow YAML file that defines triggers (push, pull request), runner environment, and a simple job structure with placeholder steps.

## 3. Implement Automated Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Configure test execution in the CI pipeline
### Details:
Add testing steps to the workflow including unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks. Configure test runners, test dependencies, and reporting of test results.

## 4. Set Up Build Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Automate the build and artifact generation process
### Details:
Configure build steps in the workflow to compile code, bundle assets, and generate deployment artifacts. Include caching strategies for dependencies and build outputs to improve pipeline efficiency.

## 5. Implement Deployment Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Create deployment jobs for different environments
### Details:
Add deployment jobs to the workflow for staging and production environments. Configure environment-specific variables, deployment conditions (manual approval vs. automatic), and rollback mechanisms.

## 6. Set Up Monitoring and Notifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.5
### Description: Configure pipeline status notifications and monitoring
### Details:
Implement status notifications via email, Slack, or other channels. Set up monitoring for pipeline health, configure failure alerts, and create dashboard for visualizing pipeline metrics and deployment history.
