# Title: Develop Machine Learning Model for Personalized Scoring
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a lightweight machine learning model that improves recommendations based on user feedback.
# Details:
1. Create ML module using scikit-learn:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import joblib

class RecommendationModel:
    def __init__(self, db_connector):
        self.db = db_connector
        self.model = None
        self.load_model()
    
    def load_model(self):
        try:
            self.model = joblib.load('ml/recommendation_model.joblib')
        except:
            # Initialize new model if none exists
            self.model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    
    def save_model(self):
        joblib.dump(self.model, 'ml/recommendation_model.joblib')
    
    def prepare_training_data(self):
        # Get feedback data from database
        query = """
        SELECT m.media_id, m.title, m.type, m.duration,
               f.watched_completion, f.would_watch_again, f.rating
        FROM media m
        JOIN user_feedback f ON m.media_id = f.media_id
        """
        data = pd.read_sql(query, self.db.engine)
        
        # Feature engineering
        X = data[['type', 'duration', 'watched_completion', 'would_watch_again']]
        # One-hot encode categorical features
        X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=['type'])
        
        # Target variable
        y = data['rating']
        
        return X, y
    
    def train(self):
        X, y = self.prepare_training_data()
        if len(X) < 10:  # Not enough data
            return False
        
        self.model.fit(X, y)
        self.save_model()
        return True
    
    def predict_score(self, media_features):
        # Prepare features in same format as training data
        # ... (implementation details)
        
        return self.model.predict([media_features])[0]
```

2. Implement model training endpoint
3. Create feature extraction from media metadata
4. Add scheduled retraining job
5. Implement model versioning and rollback capability

# Test Strategy:
1. Test model training with various dataset sizes
2. Verify prediction accuracy improves with more feedback
3. Test model persistence and loading
4. Benchmark prediction performance
5. Test with edge cases (new genres, extreme durations, etc.)

# Subtasks:
## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Gather and prepare user interaction data for model training
### Details:
Collect user behavior data, clean the dataset, handle missing values, normalize features, and split into training/validation/test sets. Ensure data privacy compliance and implement data anonymization where necessary.

## 2. Feature Engineering [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create relevant features for the personalized scoring model
### Details:
Identify and extract meaningful features from user data, including behavioral patterns, preferences, historical interactions, and contextual information. Implement feature selection techniques to determine the most predictive variables.

## 3. ML Module Architecture Design [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Design the architecture for the machine learning scoring module
### Details:
Define the ML model architecture, select appropriate algorithms (regression, classification, or ranking models), and determine how the model will interface with the existing recommendation system. Create a technical specification document.

## 4. Model Training Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement the training pipeline for the personalized scoring model
### Details:
Develop the model training code, implement hyperparameter tuning, create validation procedures, and establish metrics for model evaluation. Set up the infrastructure for model training including necessary computational resources.

### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Integrate the trained model into the recommendation system
### Details:
Develop APIs for real-time scoring, implement caching mechanisms for performance optimization, and ensure seamless integration with the existing recommendation pipeline. Include fallback mechanisms for handling prediction failures.

## 6. Model Versioning and Scheduled Retraining [done]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Implement model versioning and automated retraining processes
### Details:
Create a system for model versioning, develop automated retraining pipelines triggered by performance degradation or scheduled intervals, and implement A/B testing capabilities to compare model versions in production.

## 7. Performance Evaluation and Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 9.6
### Description: Establish monitoring systems and evaluate model performance
### Details:
Implement dashboards for tracking model performance metrics, set up alerts for performance degradation, conduct offline and online evaluation of the model, and create reports comparing the personalized scoring against baseline approaches.
