# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Docker Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with the required structure and Docker configuration for local development and deployment.
# Details:
1. Create a new repository with the following structure:
   - `/frontend`: For HTML/JS or React + Tailwind
   - `/backend`: For Python FastAPI or Flask
   - `/database`: For SQLite schema
   - `/ml`: For machine learning models
   - `/config`: For configuration files
2. Create a `Dockerfile` for containerization
3. Create `docker-compose.yml` for service orchestration
4. Setup development environment with hot-reloading
5. Configure linting and code formatting

Docker configuration should include:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "backend.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Docker container builds successfully
2. Ensure all services start correctly with docker-compose
3. Confirm development environment works with hot-reloading
4. Test that the project structure is accessible and properly organized

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Git Repository and Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git repository and set up the basic project structure with necessary directories and files.
### Details:
Create a new Git repository, initialize it with a README.md, .gitignore for Python projects, and set up the basic directory structure including src/, tests/, docs/, and config/ folders. Add initial empty __init__.py files where needed to ensure proper Python package structure.

## 2. Create Dockerfile and Docker Compose Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Develop Docker configuration files for containerized development and deployment.
### Details:
Create a Dockerfile that sets up a Python environment with all necessary dependencies. Create a docker-compose.yml file that defines services needed for development. Include volume mappings for code changes and port mappings for accessing the application. Ensure the Docker setup is optimized for both development and production environments.

## 3. Configure Development Environment [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up development tools including linting, formatting, and testing frameworks.
### Details:
Configure linting tools (flake8, pylint), code formatters (black), and type checking (mypy). Set up pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality. Create a requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt for separating production and development dependencies. Configure pytest for testing and set up initial test structure.

## 4. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Create configuration files for continuous integration and deployment workflows.
### Details:
Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD tool with workflow files for automated testing, linting, and building Docker images. Configure automated testing on pull requests. Set up deployment workflows for different environments (staging, production). Include security scanning for dependencies and Docker images.

## 5. Write Project Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the project setup and development workflow.
### Details:
Create a detailed README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and development guidelines. Document the Docker environment setup and usage. Write developer documentation explaining the project structure, coding standards, and contribution guidelines. Include documentation on how to run tests, linting, and the CI/CD process.
