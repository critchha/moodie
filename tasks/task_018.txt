# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Advanced Configuration Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a comprehensive configuration management system that allows users to customize their preferences (genre, mood/vibe mappings) and provides admin configuration endpoints for system-wide settings.
# Details:
The implementation should include:

1. User Configuration Management:
   - Create data models for storing user preferences (extending the existing user schema from Task 17)
   - Implement endpoints for users to view and update their preferences
   - Support for genre preferences with weighting system
   - Support for mood/vibe mappings customization
   - Default configuration templates for new users

2. Admin Configuration Management:
   - Secure admin-only endpoints for system-wide configuration
   - Configuration versioning and history
   - Ability to push configuration updates to all or specific user groups
   - Dashboard for monitoring configuration distribution

3. Configuration Storage and Retrieval:
   - Efficient caching mechanism for frequently accessed configurations
   - Database schema optimization for quick lookups
   - Configuration validation middleware

4. Technical Implementation:
   - Leverage FastAPI dependency injection for configuration access
   - Implement Pydantic models for configuration validation
   - Create migration scripts for the new configuration tables
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing systems
   - Implement proper error handling for configuration-related issues

5. Documentation:
   - API documentation for all configuration endpoints
   - Internal documentation on the configuration system architecture
   - User documentation explaining available configuration options

# Test Strategy:
Testing should be comprehensive and include:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test all configuration models and validation logic
   - Verify proper handling of default configurations
   - Test configuration merging and inheritance logic
   - Validate configuration versioning functionality

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test API endpoints for user preference management
   - Test admin configuration endpoints with proper authentication
   - Verify configuration propagation to users
   - Test caching mechanisms and performance

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark configuration retrieval times
   - Load test with multiple concurrent configuration updates
   - Measure database query performance for configuration lookups

4. Security Testing:
   - Verify proper access controls for admin endpoints
   - Test for potential configuration injection vulnerabilities
   - Ensure sensitive configuration data is properly protected

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for common user configuration workflows
   - Verify UI/API interactions for configuration management
   - Test configuration changes and their effects on the recommendation system

6. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure existing functionality continues to work with the new configuration system
   - Verify compatibility with the database schema from Task 17
   - Test integration with the FastAPI backend from Task 16

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design User Preference Data Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create database schemas and object models for storing user configuration preferences
### Details:
Define the data structure for user preferences including default values, data types, and relationships. Create database migration scripts and ORM models. Include versioning support for configuration changes and user-specific overrides of global settings.

## 2. Develop Admin Configuration Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Implement API endpoints for administrators to manage system-wide configuration settings
### Details:
Create RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on configuration settings. Implement role-based access control to restrict configuration management to admin users. Include batch update capabilities and audit logging for configuration changes.

## 3. Implement Configuration Caching Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Build a caching system to optimize configuration retrieval performance
### Details:
Develop a multi-level caching strategy using in-memory and distributed caching. Implement cache invalidation triggers when configurations change. Add monitoring for cache hit/miss rates and performance metrics.

## 4. Create Configuration Validation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Develop a validation framework to ensure configuration integrity and correctness
### Details:
Implement schema-based validation for configuration values. Create validation rules for data types, ranges, and dependencies between configuration items. Add support for custom validation logic and error reporting.

## 5. Prepare System Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the configuration management system
### Details:
Document API endpoints with examples, configuration schema definitions, and integration guides. Create admin user documentation explaining the configuration UI and best practices. Include developer documentation for extending the configuration system.
