# Task ID: 16
# Title: Migrate Backend from Flask to FastAPI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Transition the existing backend application from Flask to FastAPI while maintaining all current functionality and ensuring compatibility with existing systems.
# Details:
This migration requires several key steps:

1. Set up the FastAPI application structure:
   - Create a new main.py file with FastAPI initialization
   - Implement dependency injection system for database connections and other services
   - Set up proper request/response models using Pydantic
   - Configure middleware for authentication and logging

2. Port existing Flask endpoints:
   - Map all current routes to FastAPI path operations
   - Convert request parsing from Flask to FastAPI's parameter system
   - Update error handling to use FastAPI's exception system
   - Ensure all business logic remains unchanged during migration

3. Update infrastructure:
   - Modify Dockerfile to install FastAPI dependencies
   - Update deployment scripts to accommodate FastAPI's ASGI server (Uvicorn/Hypercorn)
   - Ensure environment variables and configuration management is compatible
   - Update CI/CD pipeline if necessary

4. Implement FastAPI-specific features:
   - Set up automatic API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc
   - Configure static file serving using FastAPI's StaticFiles
   - Implement proper CORS handling with FastAPI's CORSMiddleware
   - Ensure proper request validation and type checking

5. Performance considerations:
   - Benchmark the new implementation against the Flask version
   - Identify and resolve any performance bottlenecks
   - Take advantage of FastAPI's async capabilities where appropriate

The migration should be done incrementally, with careful testing at each stage to ensure no functionality is lost or altered.

# Test Strategy:
The migration should be verified through a comprehensive testing approach:

1. Functional testing:
   - Create a test matrix mapping all existing Flask endpoints to their FastAPI counterparts
   - Develop automated tests that verify each endpoint returns the same response structure and status codes
   - Test all error conditions and edge cases to ensure consistent behavior
   - Verify that authentication and authorization work correctly

2. Integration testing:
   - Run the existing API integration tests against the new FastAPI implementation
   - Ensure all tests pass with the same inputs and expected outputs
   - Test interactions with databases, caches, and external services

3. Performance testing:
   - Benchmark response times for key endpoints comparing Flask vs FastAPI
   - Test under various load conditions to ensure performance is maintained or improved
   - Verify memory usage and resource consumption

4. Documentation verification:
   - Ensure the auto-generated API documentation accurately reflects all endpoints
   - Verify that all request/response models are correctly documented
   - Test the interactive documentation features (Swagger UI)

5. Deployment testing:
   - Verify Docker builds complete successfully
   - Test deployment in staging environment
   - Ensure static files are served correctly
   - Verify CORS configuration works for all required origins

6. Regression testing:
   - Run a full suite of end-to-end tests with frontend components
   - Verify no unexpected behavior changes occurred during migration

The migration is considered complete when all tests pass, performance metrics meet or exceed the Flask implementation, and the application can be deployed successfully to the staging environment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up FastAPI Application Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial FastAPI application structure and project organization
### Details:
Create a new FastAPI project structure, set up dependency management with requirements.txt or Pipfile, configure ASGI server (Uvicorn/Hypercorn), and establish environment configuration patterns. Ensure the basic application runs with a health check endpoint.

## 2. Migrate Core API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Convert existing Flask routes to FastAPI path operations
### Details:
Systematically convert each Flask route to FastAPI path operations using the appropriate HTTP method decorators. Implement request validation with Pydantic models, convert query/path parameters, and ensure response models are properly defined.

## 3. Convert Authentication System [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Reimplement the authentication and authorization mechanisms in FastAPI
### Details:
Migrate user authentication logic to FastAPI's dependency injection system. Implement OAuth2 with Password flow or JWT authentication as needed. Set up dependency functions for authorization and convert Flask's @login_required decorators to FastAPI dependencies.

## 4. Implement API Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Set up automatic API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
### Details:
Configure FastAPI's built-in Swagger/OpenAPI documentation. Add detailed descriptions, examples, and response schemas to all endpoints. Organize endpoints into logical tags and ensure authentication requirements are properly documented.

## 5. Optimize Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Leverage FastAPI's async capabilities for performance improvements
### Details:
Identify bottleneck operations that would benefit from async/await patterns. Convert synchronous database operations to async where appropriate. Implement background tasks for long-running operations. Benchmark performance against the original Flask implementation.

## 6. Comprehensive Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5
### Description: Develop and execute test suite to validate the migration
### Details:
Create unit tests for all endpoints using FastAPI's TestClient. Develop integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality. Set up CI pipeline for automated testing. Compare test results with original Flask application to ensure feature parity and identify any regressions.
