# Task ID: 15
# Title: Finalize Docker Deployment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Complete the Docker configuration for production deployment and create documentation for installation and usage.
# Details:
1. Create a production-ready docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./ml:/app/ml
    environment:
      - PLEX_BASE_URL=${PLEX_BASE_URL}
      - PLEX_TOKEN=${PLEX_TOKEN}
      - DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/recommendations.db
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

2. Create a frontend Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:16-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

3. Create an .env.example file with required environment variables
4. Write installation and setup documentation:
   - Prerequisites (Docker, Plex server)
   - Configuration steps
   - Installation commands
   - Troubleshooting guide

5. Create scripts for backup and restore
6. Implement health checks and monitoring
7. Add volume management for persistent data

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Docker build process
2. Verify container startup and communication
3. Test with various environment configurations
4. Verify persistence across container restarts
5. Test backup and restore functionality
6. Verify documentation accuracy with fresh installation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Production Docker-Compose Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a production-ready docker-compose.yml file with proper networking, volumes, and service configurations.
### Details:
Include service definitions for all application components, configure proper restart policies, set up volume mounts for persistent data, define appropriate network settings, and optimize for production performance. Ensure secrets are properly managed and not hardcoded.

## 2. Develop Frontend Dockerfile [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an optimized Dockerfile for the frontend application with multi-stage builds.
### Details:
Implement multi-stage build process to minimize image size, configure proper Node.js environment, optimize npm/yarn caching, set up proper NGINX configuration for serving static assets, and ensure proper security headers are configured.

## 3. Implement Environment Variable Management [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Set up a secure system for managing environment variables across different deployment environments.
### Details:
Create .env file templates, document all required variables, implement a secure method for injecting secrets in production, set up validation for required variables, and ensure proper variable isolation between services.

## 4. Create Backup and Restore Scripts [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop automated scripts for backing up and restoring application data and configurations.
### Details:
Write scripts to backup database volumes, application configurations, and user-generated content. Include scheduling configuration, implement retention policies, create restore procedures, and test the entire backup/restore process.

## 5. Implement Health Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Set up health checks and monitoring for all containerized services.
### Details:
Configure Docker health checks for each service, implement monitoring endpoints, set up alerting for service failures, create dashboard for visualizing container health, and document troubleshooting procedures for common issues.

## 6. Write Comprehensive Deployment Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5
### Description: Create detailed documentation covering all aspects of the Docker deployment process.
### Details:
Document initial setup procedures, environment configuration, scaling strategies, backup/restore processes, troubleshooting guides, security considerations, and update procedures. Include diagrams of the architecture and examples of common operations.
