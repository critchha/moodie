# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Wildcard Suggestion Feature
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the surprise/wildcard suggestion option to encourage content discovery.
# Details:
1. Implement wildcard selection algorithm:

```python
def get_wildcard_suggestion(self, media_list, user_preferences):
    # Filter out media that would be in primary/backup recommendations
    scored_media = [(m, self.score_media(m, user_preferences)) for m in media_list]
    scored_media.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Remove top recommendations to avoid overlap
    if len(scored_media) > 2:
        potential_wildcards = scored_media[2:]
    else:
        potential_wildcards = scored_media
    
    # Find media that intentionally mismatches one preference
    # but still meets basic requirements (e.g., duration)
    wildcard_candidates = []
    
    for media, score in potential_wildcards:
        # Check if it's a genre/mood mismatch but time-appropriate
        if self.is_time_appropriate(media, user_preferences['time_available']):
            wildcard_candidates.append((media, score))
    
    # If we have candidates, select one randomly with preference for unwatched
    if wildcard_candidates:
        unwatched = [m for m, s in wildcard_candidates if m['view_count'] == 0]
        if unwatched:
            return random.choice(unwatched)
        return random.choice([m for m, s in wildcard_candidates])
    
    # Fallback: just return a random media item
    return random.choice(media_list) if media_list else None
```

2. Add UI toggle for wildcard suggestions
3. Implement logic to ensure wildcard picks are sufficiently different from main recommendations
4. Add tracking for wildcard acceptance rate
5. Create algorithm to adjust wildcard selection based on user feedback

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify wildcard suggestions differ meaningfully from primary/backup
2. Test that wildcards still respect time constraints
3. Verify UI toggle correctly enables/disables wildcard suggestions
4. Test with various library sizes and compositions
5. Verify tracking of wildcard acceptance rate works correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design wildcard algorithm architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the architectural design for the wildcard suggestion algorithm that selects content meaningfully different from primary recommendations
### Details:
Define the core algorithm principles, selection criteria, and diversity parameters. Document how the algorithm will balance relevance with novelty. Include pseudocode for the main selection logic and identify required data sources.

## 2. Implement UI toggle for wildcard suggestions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the user interface component that allows users to toggle wildcard suggestions on/off
### Details:
Create a visually distinct toggle in the recommendation interface. Design appropriate icons and tooltips explaining the feature. Ensure the toggle state persists across user sessions and implement smooth transitions when toggling.

## 3. Develop content differentiation logic [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement the core logic that ensures wildcard suggestions are sufficiently different from primary recommendations
### Details:
Code the differentiation metrics based on content attributes, user history, and popularity factors. Implement threshold calculations to determine sufficient difference. Create unit tests to verify differentiation effectiveness across various content types.

## 4. Implement user interaction tracking [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Create the system to track and analyze user interactions with wildcard suggestions
### Details:
Develop event tracking for wildcard-specific interactions including impressions, clicks, and engagement time. Set up data pipeline to store and process this information. Create dashboard for monitoring wildcard performance metrics.

## 5. Build feedback-based adjustment mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Develop the system that adjusts wildcard selection based on user feedback and interaction data
### Details:
Implement machine learning model that optimizes wildcard selection based on collected feedback. Create A/B testing framework to evaluate different adjustment strategies. Develop automated adjustment thresholds that respond to changing user preferences.
