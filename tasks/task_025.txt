# Task ID: 25
# Title: Task #25: Containerization Hardening and Production Deployment Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance Docker infrastructure with security-focused production-ready Dockerfiles, implement multi-environment deployment with docker-compose, set up cloud/VPS deployment automation, and integrate monitoring and logging solutions.
# Details:
This task involves several key components to ensure our containerized application is production-ready:

1. **Dockerfile Hardening**:
   - Implement multi-stage builds to reduce final image size and attack surface
   - Configure non-root user execution for all services
   - Properly manage environment variables with .env files and secrets management
   - Use specific version tags for base images rather than 'latest'
   - Add health checks to all services
   - Implement proper COPY/ADD commands with appropriate permissions
   - Remove unnecessary tools and packages from production images
   - Set appropriate USER, WORKDIR, and ENTRYPOINT directives

2. **Docker Compose Configuration**:
   - Create separate docker-compose files for development, staging, and production
   - Implement volume mounting for persistent data
   - Configure appropriate network settings and service dependencies
   - Set up resource limits (CPU, memory) for containers
   - Implement restart policies for production resilience
   - Configure proper logging drivers

3. **Cloud/VPS Deployment**:
   - Select and configure appropriate cloud provider or VPS solution
   - Set up infrastructure-as-code using Terraform or similar tool
   - Implement secure SSH access and key management
   - Configure firewall rules and security groups
   - Set up automated deployment scripts that integrate with the CI/CD pipeline (Task #24)
   - Implement container orchestration if needed (Docker Swarm or lightweight Kubernetes)
   - Configure SSL/TLS certificates and HTTPS

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement centralized logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or similar
   - Set up Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization
   - Configure alerting for critical system events
   - Implement log rotation and retention policies
   - Add application performance monitoring
   - Set up uptime and health check monitoring

The implementation should follow security best practices throughout and ensure that the deployment process is repeatable, reliable, and well-documented.

# Test Strategy:
Testing this infrastructure enhancement will require a multi-faceted approach:

1. **Dockerfile Testing**:
   - Validate image size reduction through multi-stage builds (compare before/after sizes)
   - Verify non-root user execution using `docker inspect` to confirm USER directive
   - Run security scanning tools like Trivy, Clair, or Docker Scout against images
   - Test image builds in CI pipeline to ensure reproducibility
   - Verify proper functioning of health checks
   - Conduct penetration testing on hardened containers

2. **Docker Compose Testing**:
   - Test local development environment using docker-compose up
   - Verify all services start correctly and can communicate
   - Test environment variable substitution across different environments
   - Validate volume persistence by restarting containers
   - Test resource limits by applying artificial load
   - Verify restart policies by intentionally crashing services

3. **Deployment Testing**:
   - Create a staging environment that mirrors production
   - Test the full deployment pipeline from commit to production
   - Verify rollback procedures work correctly
   - Test zero-downtime deployments
   - Validate SSL/TLS configuration using tools like SSL Labs
   - Perform load testing on the production-like environment
   - Verify firewall rules and security configurations

4. **Monitoring and Logging Testing**:
   - Verify all logs are being correctly aggregated
   - Test log queries and filtering in the logging solution
   - Validate metric collection by checking dashboards
   - Test alerting by triggering test conditions
   - Verify monitoring dashboards show accurate system health
   - Test system under various load conditions to ensure monitoring accuracy

5. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify the entire system works end-to-end across all environments
   - Test the CI/CD pipeline integration with the new deployment infrastructure
   - Conduct disaster recovery testing
   - Document all testing procedures for future reference

Success criteria include: reduced image sizes, improved security posture, successful deployments to all environments, functioning monitoring dashboards, and comprehensive logging coverage.
