# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Database Schema with ORM and Migration System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a comprehensive database schema for users, moods, recommendations, feedback, and configuration tables using SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM, and set up Alembic or equivalent for database migrations.
# Details:
1. Database Schema Design:
   - Users table: Include fields for authentication (username, email, password hash, salt), profile data (name, preferences), and account metadata (creation date, last login, status)
   - Moods table: Store user mood entries with timestamp, mood type/category, intensity level, notes, and foreign key to users
   - Recommendations table: Include recommendation content, type, relevance score, creation date, expiration, and relationships to users and/or moods
   - Feedback table: Track user feedback on recommendations with rating, timestamp, text comments, and foreign keys to both users and recommendations
   - Config table: Store application configuration parameters, feature flags, and user-specific settings

2. ORM Implementation:
   - Choose between SQLAlchemy (more mature, feature-rich) or Tortoise ORM (async-native, works well with FastAPI)
   - Define model classes with appropriate relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
   - Implement proper indexes for performance optimization
   - Set up data validation at the ORM level
   - Configure cascade behaviors for related records
   - Implement proper type hints if using SQLAlchemy

3. Migration System:
   - Set up Alembic (for SQLAlchemy) or aerich (for Tortoise ORM)
   - Create initial migration script for the base schema
   - Document the migration workflow for future schema changes
   - Implement a test migration to verify the system works correctly

4. Integration:
   - Connect the ORM models with the FastAPI backend (from Task #16)
   - Implement database connection pooling and configuration
   - Create database initialization scripts
   - Document the schema with diagrams and relationship explanations

5. Performance Considerations:
   - Ensure proper indexing for common query patterns
   - Consider partitioning strategy for tables expected to grow large
   - Implement appropriate caching mechanisms

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Write tests for each model class to verify field constraints, validation rules, and relationships
   - Test custom methods on model classes
   - Verify that default values and auto-populated fields work correctly

2. Migration Tests:
   - Test the migration system by creating a test database, applying migrations, and verifying the resulting schema
   - Test rollback functionality to ensure migrations can be reversed
   - Verify that migrations handle existing data correctly

3. Integration Tests:
   - Test the ORM models with the FastAPI endpoints
   - Verify that CRUD operations work correctly through the API
   - Test complex queries and relationships to ensure they return expected results

4. Performance Tests:
   - Benchmark common database operations with realistic data volumes
   - Test query performance with indexes vs. without indexes
   - Verify connection pooling works under load

5. Validation Approach:
   - Create a schema verification script that compares the actual database schema with the expected schema
   - Generate an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) from the implemented models and verify it matches the design
   - Manually review the migration scripts for correctness
   - Perform a code review with another team member focusing on database best practices

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - All models are properly defined with correct relationships
   - Migration system successfully creates the initial schema
   - API endpoints can perform CRUD operations using the ORM models
   - Documentation includes ERD and schema descriptions
   - Performance meets established benchmarks

### Description: Define and configure relationships between ORM models
### Details:
Implement one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. Configure cascade behaviors for related entities. Set up lazy/eager loading strategies. Ensure proper navigation properties in each model.

## 4. Set Up Migration System [done]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Implement a database migration system for version control and schema evolution
### Details:
Create initial migration script from ORM models. Set up migration configuration and versioning. Implement up/down migration methods. Create a migration runner for applying/reverting migrations. Test migration process in development environment.
