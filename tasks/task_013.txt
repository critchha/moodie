# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement ML-Based Recommendation Scoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the recommendation engine to use the trained ML model for scoring and ranking potential recommendations.
# Details:
1. Extend the recommendation module to use ML model for scoring:
   ```python
   def get_ml_recommendations(db_session, mood, group_size, session_length):
       """Get recommendations using ML model for scoring"""
       # First get candidate media using basic filtering
       candidates = get_basic_recommendations(db_session, mood, group_size, session_length)
       
       # Load the ML model
       model = load_model()
       if not model:
           # Fall back to basic recommendations if no model is available
           return candidates[:3]
       
       # Prepare features for each candidate
       candidate_scores = []
       for media in candidates:
           # Create the same feature vector used in training
           mood_funny = 1 if mood == 'funny' else 0
           mood_action = 1 if mood == 'action' else 0
           mood_dramatic = 1 if mood == 'dramatic' else 0
           mood_relaxing = 1 if mood == 'relaxing' else 0
           
           group_solo = 1 if group_size == 'solo' else 0
           group_couple = 1 if group_size == 'couple' else 0
           group_group = 1 if group_size == 'group' else 0
           
           session_short = 1 if session_length == 'short' else 0
           session_medium = 1 if session_length == 'medium' else 0
           session_binge = 1 if session_length == 'binge' else 0
           
           genres = media.genres.split(',') if media.genres else []
           genre_comedy = 1 if 'Comedy' in genres else 0
           genre_action = 1 if 'Action' in genres else 0
           genre_drama = 1 if 'Drama' in genres else 0
           genre_thriller = 1 if 'Thriller' in genres else 0
           genre_scifi = 1 if 'Science Fiction' in genres else 0
           
           features = [
               mood_funny, mood_action, mood_dramatic, mood_relaxing,
               group_solo, group_couple, group_group,
               session_short, session_medium, session_binge,
               genre_comedy, genre_action, genre_drama, genre_thriller, genre_scifi,
               media.duration or 0,
               media.year or 0
           ]
           
           # Get prediction probability
           score = model.predict_proba([features])[0][1]  # Probability of positive class
           candidate_scores.append((media, score))
       
       # Sort by score and return top 3
       sorted_candidates = sorted(candidate_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
       return [media for media, score in sorted_candidates[:3]]
   ```
2. Update the recommendation API endpoint to use ML scoring
3. Add fallback to basic recommendations when ML model is not available
4. Store prediction score with recommendation for analysis

# Test Strategy:
Test ML-based recommendations with various inputs. Compare results with and without ML scoring. Verify fallback to basic recommendations works when no model is available.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Feature Extraction Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a pipeline to extract relevant features from user data, content metadata, and interaction history for recommendation scoring.
### Details:
Create a modular feature extraction system that processes user profiles, content characteristics, and historical interactions. Implement feature normalization, encoding of categorical variables, and handling of missing data. Ensure the pipeline can be executed efficiently in real-time for scoring recommendations.

## 2. ML Model Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Integrate the trained ML model with the recommendation system to enable real-time scoring of potential recommendations.
### Details:
Develop an API or service that loads the trained ML model and accepts feature vectors as input. Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance. Create monitoring tools to track model performance and detect drift. Ensure the integration supports model versioning and A/B testing capabilities.

## 3. Score Calculation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Implement the logic to calculate final recommendation scores by combining ML model outputs with business rules and personalization factors.
### Details:
Design a scoring algorithm that weights ML model predictions alongside business priorities, content freshness, and diversity requirements. Implement configurable scoring parameters that can be adjusted without code changes. Create unit tests to verify scoring behavior across different scenarios.

## 4. Fallback Mechanism Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Develop robust fallback strategies for handling edge cases, cold starts, and model failures in the recommendation scoring system.
### Details:
Implement tiered fallback approaches including popularity-based recommendations, content similarity, and editorial selections. Create logic to detect when the ML scoring is unreliable or unavailable. Design the system to gracefully degrade performance rather than fail completely. Document fallback behaviors for operational support.

## 5. Result Ranking and Presentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Develop the final ranking algorithm to sort recommendations based on scores and implement the presentation layer for displaying results.
### Details:
Create an efficient sorting mechanism that can handle large recommendation sets. Implement diversity rules to prevent similar items from clustering together. Design a caching strategy for frequently requested recommendation sets. Develop APIs that return properly formatted recommendation results with explanation metadata when requested.
